# TrialMan Mode Custom Plugin 
The game mode is defined by the player being limited to standing on certain tiles. The amount of tiles you are allowed to stand on depends on the trials you've completed. 

This plugin sets out to make the marking of tiles and the counting of both your used and remaining tiles automated.

## Features
Automatically fill in tiles as you walk/run with 'Auto-mark'.

Draw tiles on the minimap.

Ability for the tiles/overlay change colour to notify you when you've gone over your set tile limit or when you use up all your tiles.

Option to add additional tiles to your total usable tiles.

Ability to import marked tiles, if you started playing using the Ground Marker plugin or the Tileman Mode plugin.

## Known Issues
Moving between map chunks will sometimes cause tiles to be missed.
(I'll try to fix this after I finish implementing the base ruleset for this plugin)
